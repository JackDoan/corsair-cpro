This is a kernel driver for the Corsair Commander Pro.

Features:
Recognize connected fans, read fan speeds.
Read connected thermal sensors.
Set fan speed with single pwm value.
Read voltage values.


If you would like to test it, clone the repository.
make && sudo insmod corsair-cpro.ko

If you run sensors, it should show up.

Features in /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*
fan*_label shows the number and the connection status.

pwm* is writable and takes numbers from 0-255.
temp*_input shows the tempature.
in0_label voltage on 12v rail
in1_label voltage on 5v rail
